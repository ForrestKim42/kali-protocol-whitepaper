  ## Overview

  Project KALI addresses the fundamental challenge of global financial
  exclusion affecting 1.4 billion adults worldwide. Unlike traditional
  approaches, KALI proposes a decentralized protocol that "re-embeds"
  finance within community and social trust frameworks, transforming
  foreign aid from one-time disbursements into sustainable credit creation
  systems.

  ## The Problem

  - **1.4 billion adults** remain excluded from formal financial systems
  - **7.5% leakage rate** in traditional foreign aid distribution
  - **High operational costs** in microfinance leading to predatory
  interest rates
  - **Structural inefficiencies** in current aid and financial inclusion
  models

  ## The Solution

  KALI Protocol introduces an innovative approach through:

  ### üè¶ **Transparent Treasury System**
  - Aid funds (USDC, USDT) deposited into on-chain Treasury
  - Funds serve as collateral for interest-free credit limits
  - Complete transparency through blockchain technology

  ### üí≥ **Programmable Credit System**
  - Native stablecoin (KUSD) enables programmable aid
  - Use-case restrictions ensure proper fund allocation
  - Credit ladder system rewards consistent repayment

  ### üåê **Last-Mile Bridge Technology**
  - **SMS/USSD Gateway**: Full functionality via feature phones
  - **Bluetooth Mesh Network**: Offline P2P transactions
  - **No smartphone required**: Accessible to all user demographics

  ### üèõÔ∏è **DAO Governance**
  - Community-driven decision making
  - Transparent fund allocation
  - Democratic protocol management

  ## Key Innovations

  1. **Re-embedded Finance**: Integrates financial services with community
  trust networks
  2. **Sustainable Aid Model**: Shifts from disbursement to credit creation
  3. **Universal Accessibility**: Works without smartphones or internet
  connectivity
  4. **Transparent Operations**: All transactions visible on blockchain
  5. **Self-Sustaining Growth**: Credit ladder enables financial
  independence

  ## Technical Architecture

  The KALI Protocol operates on multiple layers:

  - **Layer 1**: Blockchain infrastructure for transparency and security
  - **Layer 2**: Smart contracts for credit management and governance
  - **Layer 3**: Gateway services for SMS/USSD and offline capabilities
  - **Layer 4**: User interfaces and community tools

  ## Target Impact

  - **Primary**: 1.4 billion financially excluded adults
  - **Secondary**: MSMEs requiring access to credit
  - **Tertiary**: Aid organizations seeking efficient distribution methods
